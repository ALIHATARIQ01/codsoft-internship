### NUMBER GUESSING GAME
- This is link for task 1 [NUMBER GUESSING GAME](https://github.com/ALIHATARIQ01/codsoft-internship/tree/main/task1_number_guessing_system)
- "The Number Guessing Game is a classic and simple yet entertaining game where a user tries to guess a secret number chosen by the computer randomly. The objective of the game is for the player to guess the correct number within a predefined range, typically between 1 and 250. The player provides their guess, and the game provides feedback, informing the player whether their guess is  high or low number. Through a process of trial and error, the player continues to refine their guess until they finally guess the correct number, at which point they win the game. It's a fun and engaging way to test your intuition and logic while enjoying the thrill of trying to crack the code."

### calculator
- This is link for task 2 [calculator](https://github.com/ALIHATARIQ01/codsoft-internship/tree/main/task2_calculator)
- The provided C++ code is a versatile calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on different data types, including integers, doubles, and floats. It employs templates to handle various data types, ensuring flexibility. The user is prompted to choose a data type and an operation to perform, and then the program utilizes the corresponding calculator instance to execute the operation. Error handling is in place to prevent division by zero and invalid operations.
Additionally, it offers the option to continue using the calculator after each calculation. This code is a practical demonstration of C++ templates and user-driven arithmetic operations.

### TIC TAC TOE
- This is link for task 1 [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://github.com/ALIHATARIQ01/codsoft-internship/tree/main/task3_tic_tac_toe_game)
- "Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player strategy game that is easy to learn and quick to play. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to be the first player to form a line of three of their own symbols, either 'X' or 'O,' horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns placing their symbols on the grid, with 'X' typically going first. The challenge lies in anticipating your opponent's moves while strategically placing your own symbols to block them and create opportunities to win.
### TO DO LIST
- This is link for task 2 [TO DO LIST](https://github.com/ALIHATARIQ01/codsoft-internship/tree/main/task4_to_do_list)
- This code serves as a foundational example of how to create a basic to-do list management system in C++. It uses a struct called Task to store task descriptions and completion status. Users can add, view, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list. The program provides a menu-driven interface for these actions. It utilizes an array to store tasks, with a maximum capacity defined by MAX_TASKS which is 100.
