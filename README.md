This is a paragraph of text in a README file.
"The Number Guessing Game is a classic and simple yet entertaining game where a user tries to guess a secret number chosen by the computer randomly. The objective of the game is for the player to guess the correct number within a predefined range, typically between 1 and 250. The player provides their guess, and the game provides feedback, informing the player whether their guess is  high or low number. Through a process of trial and error, the player continues to refine their guess until they finally guess the correct number, at which point they win the game. It's a fun and engaging way to test your intuition and logic while enjoying the thrill of trying to crack the code."
